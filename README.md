# actix-auth

I am a novice at best, I do many things wrong, but I do things clearly and generally simply.

I could not find any simple examples so I thought I might aswell put this out for anyone like me.

A truly simple illustration of basic authorisation using [actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) and [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver) with [rust-argon2](https://github.com/sru-systems/rust-argon2).

On the `front-end` branch you will also find an illustration of an implementation of a basic front end using [Sailfish](https://github.com/Kogia-sima/sailfish).
